## Ingredients

**Base (Rice & Liquids)**
- 125 g risotto rice (uncooked)
- 0.75 L water
- 1 teaspoon bouillon powder
- 200 ml light coconut milk

**Protein**
- 300 g chicken breast cubes

**Vegetables**
- 400 g Asian stir-fry vegetables
- 1 clove garlic

**Sauces & Seasoning**
- 1 teaspoon green curry paste
- Salt & pepper (to taste)

## Steps

1. Heat some oil in a pan and sauté the minced garlic.
2. Add the risotto rice and stir well.
3. Mix the water with the bouillon and slowly add it to the rice, a little at a time, adding more only when the previous liquid is absorbed.
4. Season the chicken cubes with salt and pepper, cook them in a separate pan, then add the stir-fry vegetables. Cook until slightly tender but still crisp.
5. In a small bowl, mix the coconut milk with the green curry paste.
6. Add the cooked risotto to the chicken and vegetables. Pour in the coconut–curry mixture and let it thicken until creamy.
7. Enjoy!
